# Homework / Lab Assignments 1

## Homework 1
You are a banker and someone walks into a bank and gives you a stack of pennies --- hundreds of thousands of pennies, if you will --- and asks you to break them into the largest units of USD currency possible. Your customer also wants to know how much these pennies are worth in Canadian dollars.

For example, 123 pennies translates to 1 dollar, 2 dimes and 3 pennies. Additionally 123 US pennies correspond to 1.33 Canadian dollars with today's exchange rate.

Your homework assignment is to write a simple console application that takes a user's numeric "pennies" input and returns a string output (using the USD units of currency).

### Example Console Output
<pre>
Please enter all of your pennies:
<b>8888</b>
In US currency you have: 88 dollars, 3 quarters, 1 dime, 0 nickels, and 3 pennies.
In Canadian currency you have: 118.210400 dollars.

## Ch02-05
1. A room has one door, two windows, and a built-in bookshelf and it needs to be painted.  Suppose that one gallon of paint can paint 120 swuare fett.  Write a Python program that prompts the user to input the lengths and widths of the door, each window, the bookshelf; and the length, width, and height of the room (in feet).  The program outputs the amount of paint needed to paint the walls of the room (no ceiling and floor).

\*************************************************************************************

OUTPUT:

&ndash; The bold text is the user's input.

\*************************************************************************************
<pre>
Enter the length and width of the door: <b>6 3</b>
Enter the length and width of the first window: <b>3 3</b>
Enter the length and width of the second window: <b>3 4</b>
Enter the length and width of the bookshelf: <b>5 5</b>
Enter the length, width, and height of the room: <b>15 15 12</b>

The amount of paint needed to paint the room: 5.47 gallons.
